# DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 6

I completed the tutorial in experiment 1 first.

In experiment 2 I used the template html and css given. I did not bother
to spend any extra time on styling and layout. It took me some time to figure out the basics of Angular as I am much more familiar with React. In the end I spent a lot of time fixing CORS issues, but in the end got it to work.

HTTP methods used: GET, POST, DELETE.
All seem to work, although the application is not exactly user-friendly.
I also did not implement any validation on the user input for adding a todo item.

No pending issues remain.
