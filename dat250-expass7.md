# DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 7

I decided to use TypeScript with Deno to complete the tutorials.
I first installed RabbitMQ with chocolately, and then installed Docker to use as a way of running a rabbitmq server instance.

Docker did not work at first, and I had to uninstall WSL and reinstall to get it to work. Furthermore, I had some issues as a result of choosing to use Deno for running my programs, as the client library I used was meant for Node, but I found a quick fix in Deno's manual regarding support for Node modules.

I got a basic "Hello World" Sender/Consumer pattern to work for experiment 2. Experiment 3 took some more time figuring out, but I got there in the end. Experiment 4 went pretty smoothly.

No pending issues remain.
